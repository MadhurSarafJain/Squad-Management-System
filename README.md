# Squad-Management-System
This Project aims to provide a Database Management System for Cricket Authorities to manage squads for Franchise Cricket. This will contain a main pool of players in which a player belongs to a particular team. This segregation of players can be made easy by using our Application. We will show all the statistics of the player and also we can view the current status of every team. Players,coaches,sponsors and their grounds can be seen using separate teams. The players in the player pool can also be sorted based on their different attributes like Runs,Wickets,Centuries etc. New players can be added to the pool and due to this feature and access to the database, an admin profile has been created to avoid mismanagement of data whose data can also be viewed and password can be changed.
